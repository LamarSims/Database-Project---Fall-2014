# Database-Project---Fall-2014
My College Database Project from Georgia Southern University

Group Project

This project will deal with government officials and bills of Georgia. At a critical time when elections for new officials has passed, we
figured creating a database that could show you the government officials and the bills theyâ€™ve been working on would be beneficial to
make. One of the many things a government official does it created bills that could possibly become laws. With the creation of a
user-friendly interface, you could access such information as which government official represents your county and also which bills was
voted either yes or no.
